Federated learning is a machine learning strategy that allows machine learning models to gain experience from different data sets located in separate locations (for example, a local data centre) without having to share training data.
Their major goal is to create machine learning models using data sets dispersed across several devices while avoiding data loss.

The advantages of using Federated Machine Learning are:
• Data Security: Keeping the training dataset on the devices eliminates the need for a data pool for the model.
• Real-Time Learning: There is no need to aggregate data for continuous learning because models are continually upgraded using client data.
• Hardware Efficient: Because federated learning models do not require a single complex central server to interpret data, this technique requires less complex hardware
